NIP-169
======

Reaction images
---------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines two new event kinds, kind `10169` user image collection and `30169` image collection

## User reaction images (10104)

The user reaction images event should use the kind `10104` and have either `"a"` tags that point to reaction image sets (kind `30169`) or [NIP-92](92.md) `"imeta"` tags

Example:

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 10169,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    // favorite reaction images
    [
      "imeta",
      "url https://media.tenor.com/Ks6q5fO7BIgAAAAC/kung-fu-panda.gif",
      "x 4503843ceec973fe510f288acc71ed95576d6991ba06cf10b197341deccea86d",
      "m image/gif",
      "dim 217x219",
      "blurhash LCI|55~8=_xY-8ENE4E404XRk8sm",
      "summary kung fu panda kung fu panda",
      "alt a cartoon character is sitting at a table with bowls of food",
      "thumb https://media.tenor.com/Ks6q5fO7BIgAAAAx/kung-fu-panda.webp",
      "image https://media.tenor.com/Ks6q5fO7BIgAAAAe/kung-fu-panda.png"
    ],
    // favorite gif packs
    ["a", "30169:3bf0c63fcb93463407af97a5e5ee64fa883d107ef9e558472c4eb9aaaefa459d:2000s-gifs"]
  ]
}
```

## Reaction image set

A reaction image set is a [NIP-51](51.md) set that uses the kind `30169` and has [NIP-92](92.md) `"imeta"` tags

Aside from their main identifier, the "d" tag, sets can optionally have a "title", an "image" and a "description" tags that can be used to enhance their UI.

Example:

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 30169,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "2000s-gifs"],
    ["title", "The best gifs of 2000"],
    ["image", "https://cdn.example.com/images/2000s-gifs.png"],
    ["description", "A collection of all the best memes from the early 2000s"],
    // multiple imeta tags for images
    [
      "imeta",
      "url https://images.example.com/c01806b3456673668d45e6c55accb88b6b8fdbdd4aefbcab43615bff4c22d9b1.gif",
      "m image/gif",
      "blurhash LCGIGvj?M{s:~W%2ayRj4.%2t7Rj",
      "dim 360x274",
      "alt a man in a suit and tie is singing into a microphone while saying you'll let me hold your hand",
      "summary I want to hold your hand beatles",
      "x c01806b3456673668d45e6c55accb88b6b8fdbdd4aefbcab43615bff4c22d9b1",
      "thumb https://media.tenor.com/UZmssvHo5CMAAAAx/beatles.webp",
      "image https://media.tenor.com/UZmssvHo5CMAAAAe/beatles.png",
      "fallback https://nostrcheck.me/alt1.gif",
      "fallback https://void.cat/alt1.gif"
    ],
    [
      "imeta",
      //...
    ],
    [
      "imeta",
      //...
    ]
  ]
}
```

## Thumbnails

Its strongly recommended that `"imeta"` tags have a `thumb` property to allow client apps to easily render them without any performance issues

Client may also choose to ignore or hide `"imeta"` tags that do not have a `thumb`
