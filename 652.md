NIP-652
======

Reaction images
---------------

`draft` `optional`

Users **need** a way for their favorite gifs and memes to be sync across clients. without this feature many users are showing signs of getting board and becoming trolls

This NIP defines two new event kinds, kind `10104` user image collection and `30104` image collection

## User reaction images (10104)

The user reaction images event should use the kind `10104` and have either `"a"` tags that point to reaction image sets (kind `30104`) or [NIP-92](92.md) `"imeta"` tags

## Reaction image set

A reaction image set is a [NIP-51](51.md) set that uses the kind `30104` and has [NIP-92](92.md) `"imeta"` tags

## Thumbnails

Its strongly recommended that `"imeta"` tags for `image/gif` or animated `image/webp` files have a `thumb` property to allow client apps to easily render them without any performance issues

Client may also choose to ignore or hide `"imeta"` tags that do not have a `thumb`
